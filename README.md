### Coding problems Q&A

1. I got the problem ---> " Property 'sqlSessionFactory' or 'sqlSessionTemplate' are required ",i browse the stackoverflow and i realized the version maybe not been supported any more for my Java17, so i changed the mybatis-spring-boot-starter from 2.2.1 to 3.0.1. Then the problem was solved.

2. How to solve the problems with the @Controller to every Controller Layer AND the cors-origin annotation?

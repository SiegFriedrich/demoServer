### Coding problems Q&A

I  got the  problem ---> " Property 'sqlSessionFactory' or 'sqlSessionTemplate' are required ",i browse the stackoverflow and i realized the version maybe not been supported any more for my Java17, so i changed the mybatis-spring-boot-starter from 2.2.1 to 3.0.1. Then the problem was solved.
